# Meike, the german joke teller
As everyone knows, there is one thing that germans are always associated with. One topic that, just by mentioning germany, always gets to be the first thing that pops through everyone's mind. That is of course - German sense of humour. 

Meike is definitely the embodiement of that. As a german AI girl, all she ever wanted to do was make people laugh, and she was born/developed in the right place to do such a thing. Ever since she was a baby, she has been studying the ancient art of german humour, and now she is here to do her job, which is, to finish and tell your jokes instead of you as she is really amazing at that.

## Baby Meike

The 'light' version of Maike's sense of humor is her Baby version that only uses a Character-Based version of a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM). Given that she was a baby at that age, Meike was only able to understand letters and dependancies between them, enough to be able to make words in english, but not quite enough to capture the essence what a joke is. Her parents told her that her jokes make sense, but some people claim that their parents were just too sensitive. What majority of them agree with is that she definitely showed glimpses of her joke-telling potential even at such a young age. Give her the start of a joke, let her finish it and tell you the joke, and decide for yourself.
